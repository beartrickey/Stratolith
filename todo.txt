* Make items selectable on radar

* Add image file attribute to drone hashtables

* Make stage based only on using cannon and collecting items with convoy drone?

* Work on fourth wave type

* Drones utilize different wave types

* Cannon has limited number of uses per stage

* Put drones into JSON object
	-drone paths

* Allow for scripted (non-random) stages for the tutorial/demo stages

* Stage generation
	-Difficulty
		-Evenly match nullifiable and unnullifiable drone stats
		-All drone stats add up to same number
			-Make algorithm to achieve this

	-Unify drone types and paths
		-Don't have close range drones circle around radar (they'll never be able to attack the stratolith)

	-Stretch time out a bit more to allow for r-scanning, salvaging, and drone maintenance

* Items
	-Items are saved if drone survives conflict or docks


* Stage End
	-Show found items
	
	-Pick drone to keep in dock(s)


* Loading screen has moving clouds?
